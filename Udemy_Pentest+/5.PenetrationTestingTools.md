# Domain 4 - Penetration Testing Tools
## INtro
- Use Nmap to conduct informaiton gathering
compare and contrast various tools
analylze tool output or data
  - password cracking, pass the hash, injections, setting up bind or reverse shells, upload web shell
- analyze basic script
  - bash, Python, Ruby, and Powershell


RCP 793
## Test questions
- Majority are "given a scenario"
- "compare and contrast" various tools
- expect to get simulations here

### Nmap
- command line tool that send specially crafted packets to the target host(s) of a network
- discovers the hosts and services beign run based on the responses recieved

### post scan results
  - open
    - application is acceptin connections
  - Closed
    - No application is listening
  - Filtered
    - Probes arent reaching port

##### Nmap Basic Commands
- sS
  - SYN scan - default and most poular
  - can scan 1000 ports per second
  - never completes the TCP connection
- sT
  - TCP connect scan
  - uses the OS to send packets
  - completes the TCP connection (less stealthy)
- p 
  - specifies the port to scan (overriding defaults)
- O
  - Enables OS detection
- Pn
  - skips the host discovery
  - treats all hosts in the range as online
- iL
  - loads targets from a text file
- T
  - sets the timing for the scan
    -T0 - paranoid
    -T1 - sneaky
    -T2 polite
    -T3 - normal
    -T4 aggressive
    -T5 insane

#### Nmap Output
- oN
  - normal outpout format
  > namp -oN outputfile.txt <target ip>
- oG
  - grepable output
  >  > namp -oG outputfile.txt <target ip>
- oX
  - XML output
  >  > namp -oX outputfile.txt <target ip>
- oA
  - combined format of all types
  >  > namp -oA outputfile.txt <target ip>

  ## Use cases for tools
  - Recon
    - collecting informaiton before attacking an IT system
    - usually conducted using open source informaitono or passive collection
    TOOLS: whois, NsLookup, Theharvester, Shodan, Recon-NG, Censys, Aircrack-NG, Kismet, WiFite(2), Wireshark, Hping, SET, Nmap, Metasploit framework

  - Enumeration
    - establishes an active connection to the targets to discover potential attack vectors
    - Ususally conducted active techniques and fingerprinting
  TOOLS: NsLookup, wireshark, Hping, Nmap

  - Vulnerability Scanning
    - in-depth scanning of a taget to determine its vulnerabilites
    -uses automate tools to determine missing patches adn incorret configuarations
TOOLS: Nikto, OpanVAS, NEssus, SQLmap, W3AF, OWASP ZAP, Nmap, Metaspolit

 - Credential Attacks
  - offline password cracking
    - john the ripper, mimikatz, cain and abell, hashcat, aircrack-ng
  - Brute forcing services
    - SQLmap (for databases), Medusa, hydra, W3AF, Mimikatz, Cain and Abel, Patator, Aircrack-ng

- Persistence
  - Maintaining a foothold into the network or victim system
  TOOLS: SET, BeEF, SSH NCAT, NETCAT, Drozer, Powersploit, Empire, Metasploit

- Configuration Compliance
  - Ensuring a system meets a given security baseline or policy
TOOLS: Nikto, OpenVAS, Nessus, SQLmap, Nmap

- Evasion
- Hide from the system administrators or defenders
TOOLS: proxychains, SET, Metasploit, Route

- Decompilation
  - Reversing an executable into human readable code
  TOOLS: IDA, Hopper, Immunity debugger, APK studio, APKX

- Forensics
  - Tools used to collect and analyze digital evidence for crimes and analysis
  TOOLS: foremost, FTK, EnCase, Tableau

Debugging
  - Process of finding and resolving defects in com0puter proggram
