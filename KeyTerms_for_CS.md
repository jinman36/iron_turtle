- Ciphertext - The result of encrypting a plaintext, encrypted data

- Cipher - A method of encrypting or decrypting data. Modern ciphers are cryptographic, but there are many non cryptographic ciphers like Caesar.

- Plaintext - Data before encryption, often text but not always. Could be a photograph or other file

- Encryption - Transforming data into ciphertext, using a cipher.

- Encoding - NOT a form of encryption, just a form of data representation like base64. Immediately reversible.

- Key - Some information that is needed to correctly decrypt the ciphertext and obtain the plaintext.

- Passphrase - Separate to the key, a passphrase is similar to a password and used to protect a key.

- Asymmetric encryption - Uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt.

- Symmetric encryption - Uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt

B- rute force - Attacking cryptography by trying every different password or every different key

- Cryptanalysis - Attacking cryptography by finding a weakness in the underlying maths
